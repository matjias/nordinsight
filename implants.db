It is often safe to perform MRI on an individual that has an orthopaedic implant device. The main issues affecting the safety of passive implants (medical devices that serve their function without the supply of power) in the MR environment involve magnetically induced displacement force and torque and radio frequency (RF) induced heating. The MR static field induces displacement forces and torques on ferromagnetic materials. However, both ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic metallic devices of certain geometries may experience heating caused by interactions with the RF field. Of secondary concern is the possibility of image artifacts that can compromise image quality. Implant Movement Zimmer metallic implants are manufactured using one or more of the following non-ferromagnetic materials: commercially pure titanium (CP Titanium), Ti-6Al-4V alloy, Ti-6Al-7Nb alloy, several Co-Cr alloys (ASTM F75, F562, and F90), tantalum (Trabecular Metal™ Material), and the following implant grade stainless steels: 316L, REX 734, 22-13-5 and Biodur 108. Zimmer’s internal testing has revealed that although each metallic material exhibits a small but measurable magnetic attraction in the 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla environments, the maximum magnetic force exerted on a device (stainless steel) is less than 25% of the force exerted on the device due to gravity1. None of the metallic materials exhibited any torque movement in 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla MR environments. Therefore, no movement or deflection of Zimmer devices manufactured from the aforementioned metallic materials is expected in 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla MR environments. The polymer (plastic) and ceramic materials used in the manufacture of some Zimmer implants are non-metallic and non-ferromagnetic and pose no risk of movement or deflection due to exposure to the MR environment. Implant Heating In regards to RF induced heating, one recent publication states “…..to date, there has been no report of a patient being seriously injured as a result of excessive heat that developed in a \"passive\" metallic implant or device. However, heating is potentially problematic for implants that have an elongated shape or those that form a conducting loop of a certain diameter2.” The RF induced heating of Zimmer implants is currently being tested and the results will be made available upon completion.

The systems include osseointegrated titanium implants and titanium abutments that protrude through the skin. A Vistafix prosthesis is worn on the head.  Cochlear Vistafix implants offer patients a high level of MRI compatibility. These guidelines are intended for radiologists performing MRI scans on a patient with a Cochlear Vistafix System. Please read this information carefully. For more information, contact Cochlear. As long as the Vistafix prosthesis, bar construction, any fixation magnets, magnabutments or magnacaps are removed for the MRI procedure, a patient fitted with a Vistafix System may be exposed to an MRI examination. When undergoing an MRI, the following conditions apply. The prosthesis, the bar construction, any fixation magnets, magnabutments or magnacaps attached to the implants must be removed before entering a room where an MRI scanner is located.  Non-clinical testing has demonstrated that Vistafix implants, cover screws, and abutments are MR Conditional at 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla. They can be scanned safely under the following conditions. Scanning under other conditions may result in severe patient injury or device malfunction. MR System manufacturers may claim that scanning patients with implanted devices is generally contraindicated. This is a general precautionary claim due to the fact that MR System manufacturers are unable to ensure safety for all types of implantable devices. Cochlear has performed specific testing for the above implants and established the necessary SAR safety limits as outlined. Recently available MR Systems are able to monitor SAR levels. The MR System manufacturer should be able to provide advice on how to maintain SAR levels with their system.
