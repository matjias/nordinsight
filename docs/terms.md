decisions made based on the information provided and that you assume full responsibility for verifying MRI
safety conditions before proceeding with any medical procedure.

However, NordInsight does not guarantee that any insurance company, payer, or regulatory body will accept,
acknowledge, or reimburse claims based on reports generated using this tool.
While NordInsight will conform to updates in CMS guidelines and uphold a best-practice approach, it
